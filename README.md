# Syntax_Error_Project
Hello,
      We, members of team "Tetrahedron" have developed an android calculator/unit converter.We are beginner developers and wanted to develop
      a mobile app which is not much simple nor much complicated to develop.We learned the Android Development just 1 week prior to the
      hackathon and thus began our developing journey.Thus, we choose to begin with a calculator with more functions than a normal one
      like factorial,log,power,etc.. as well as with a unit converter which includes conversion of Area,Length,Volume and Weight. We used
      Android Studio platform to build it and the code was xml language for design and java language for activities like functioning of 
      buttons/user input."Only the xml files for designing and mainactivity files for java codes are written by us.Rest are provided by
      Android Studio as default files".
      
      It was fun to build with teammates and competitors around pushing you to work more.With the helpful members of 
      SDS labs always there to solve your doubts,it was a overall fun and exciting event.We will add the scientific and programmable 
      functions to our calculator once we become more familiar with the field of android development and we plan on extending the app
      to the IOS operating system too.We also tried showing the history of the previous calculations but we were unable to do it since
      it involves storing user's data in a database and then fetching it.So we plan on adding this function too to our calculator.
      This was our first hackathon and it became a lifetime memory.Thus,we are glad to participate in this hackathon.Our main goal to
      participate is to learn new things about development and it indeed was worth participating.
